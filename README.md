# Bi-LSTM for Evidence Detection

This repository contains the implementation of a bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network designed for the task of evidence detection in text data. The model processes and classifies textual inputs to identify information that can be considered as evidence within a given context.

## Setup

To set up the necessary environment:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/azibbrrrrr/Bi-LSTM
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the demo code and get the output file, open the BiLSTM_demo.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment and execute the cells sequentially.
